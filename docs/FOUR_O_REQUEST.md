# 4o Request Guide

This document describes how the bot communicates with model **4o**.

Requests are sent as HTTP `POST` to the URL stored in the environment variable
`FOUR_O_URL` (defaults to `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`). The
header `Authorization: Bearer <FOUR_O_TOKEN>` is added. Set these values via Fly
secrets.

Payload:
```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "<contents of PROMPTS.md>"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "<original event text>"}
  ]
}
```

The response must be JSON with the fields listed in `docs/PROMPTS.md`.
Edit this file or `docs/PROMPTS.md` to fine‑tune the request details.

The command `/ask4o <text>` sends an arbitrary user message to the same
endpoint and returns the assistant reply. It is intended for quick diagnostics
and available only to the superadmin.
