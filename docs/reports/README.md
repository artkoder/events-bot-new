# Reports (Index)

Reports are **human-facing** documents that capture context:
investigations, reviews, retrospectives, and implementation plans.

## What belongs here

- Postmortems and incident writeups
- “Why we changed X” investigations
- Implementation plans that guide multi-step work
- Code reviews that should be preserved beyond PR history

## What does NOT belong here

- Feature behavior specs (put into `docs/features/<feature>/`)
- Raw logs / dumps (put into `artifacts/`)
